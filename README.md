**Armenian Reddit Post Idea Generator & A/B Testing Platform**

Scrapes Armenian news media and history journals, analyzes Reddit engagement patterns, generates optimized post ideas, and implements A/B testing to continuously improve post effectiveness.

---

## Features

- **Multi-source scraping** — Armenian news (Armenpress, Asbarez, Armenian Weekly, Hetq, etc.) and history sources (Wikipedia, academic portals)
- **Reddit engagement analysis** — Collects top posts from target subreddits, extracts features (title structure, keywords, sentiment, posting time), and surfaces actionable patterns
- **AI-informed post generation** — Creates Reddit post ideas modelled after high-engagement patterns
- **Approval workflow** — Review, edit, approve, or reject generated ideas via a web dashboard
- **A/B testing** — Generate multiple title variants per post, post them, track metrics, and determine statistical winners
- **Performance tracking** — Monitor score, upvote ratio, and comments over time for posted content
- **Scheduled automation** — Background jobs for scraping, data collection, analysis, and metric refreshes

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to add/remove scraping sources, adjust Reddit analysis parameters, or tune A/B testing thresholds.

Key settings in `.env`:
- `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` / `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` — Reddit API credentials
- `TARGET_SUBREDDIT` — The subreddit to post to (default: `armenia`)
- `ANALYSIS_SUBREDDITS` — Comma-separated list of subreddits to analyze for engagement patterns
- `SCRAPE_INTERVAL_MINUTES` — How often to auto-scrape (default: 60)

## Reddit API Compliance

This project uses the Reddit API under the [Reddit Developer Terms](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/42728983564564-Responsible-Builder-Policy) and the [Reddit Data API Terms](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/18591005200404). Below is a summary of the key terms and how Hye-tasion complies.

### Developer Terms Summary

| Area | Requirement | How We Comply |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Registration** | Valid Reddit account in good standing; keep API credentials secure | Credentials stored in `.env` (never committed); script-type app |
| **Allowed Use** | Non-exclusive, revocable license for API access; attribute User Content with links and usernames | Reddit posts displayed with permalink and `u/author` attribution |
| **No Commercial Use** | Don't monetize Reddit data or use it in paid services without a separate agreement | Hye-tasion is a personal/community tool with no monetization |
| **No AI/ML Training** | Don't use Reddit data to train models without permission | Only statistical pattern analysis (percentiles, keyword frequency); no model training |
| **Rate Limits** | Don't circumvent or exceed rate limits | PRAW handles `X-Ratelimit-*` headers; app adds delays between submissions |
| **Content Removal** | Delete local copies if content is removed from Reddit | Scheduled cleanup job checks for removed/deleted posts and purges stale data |
| **No Spam** | Don't spam or harass users | Posting cooldowns, sequential variant posting with delays, daily caps per subreddit |
| **User Agent** | Properly identify your bot | Format: `script:HyeTasion:1.0 (by /u/username)` |
| **Privacy** | Comply with data protection laws; don't share Reddit data with third parties | Data stays local in SQLite; no third-party sharing |
| **Termination** | Reddit can revoke access at any time; delete all data if terminated | All Reddit data stored in a single DB; can be wiped cleanly |
| **Liability** | Reddit provides everything "as-is"; max liability $100; you indemnify Reddit | Acknowledged — personal use tool |

### Data API Terms Summary

| Area | Requirement | How We Comply |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **User Content license** | May copy and display User Content; may only modify to format for display | We display titles/scores as-is; formatting only for HTML rendering |
| **No AI/ML training** | Cannot use User Content to train ML/AI models without rightsholder permission | No model training; engagement analysis uses only statistical aggregation |
| **No commercial use** | Cannot sell, lease, sublicense, or derive revenue from Data APIs without written approval | Non-commercial personal/community project |
| **OAuth required** | Must use OAuth tokens; must not misrepresent user agent or OAuth identity | PRAW handles OAuth; user agent set per Reddit's format |
| **Attribution** | Must display "for Reddit" branding (e.g., "HyeTasion for Reddit") | Shown in frontend header and footer |
| **Rate limits** | Reddit can set and enforce limits; exceeding can result in permanent revocation | PRAW rate limiter + application-level cooldowns |
| **On termination** | Must delete all cached User Content, Materials, **and derived data/models** | Cleanup job purges raw posts + derived fields; DB can be wiped entirely |
| **Third-party libraries** | Must comply with PRAW's own terms when using it | PRAW used per its BSD license terms |
| **Confidentiality** | Protect any Reddit confidential information | No Reddit confidential info stored or shared |
| **Future fees** | Reddit reserves the right to charge for API access | Acknowledged; will comply if pricing is introduced |

### Compliance Controls

- **Rate limiting** — PRAW's built-in rate limiter + configurable delays between posts (`POSTING_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` in `.env`)
- **Attribution** — "for Reddit" branding in frontend header/footer; collected Reddit posts include author and permalink linking back to original content
- **Data retention** — Background job periodically checks stored posts against Reddit and removes deleted/suspended content; configurable retention period via `DATA_RETENTION_DAYS`
- **Spam prevention** — Minimum interval between submissions, daily posting cap per subreddit, duplicate-post detection
- **Credential security** — All secrets in `.env` (gitignored), never hardcoded
